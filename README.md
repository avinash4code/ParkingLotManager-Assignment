# ParkingLotManager-Assignment

## Functional Requirements for the app
Design and implement a Parking Spot Finder application. This app is used by a parking lot attendant to find the right open spot for the car entering parking lot.

### The parking lot has following properties:
	• Parking lot consists of series of parking spots spread over a ground
	• A parking spot can be one of three sizes: hatchback, sedan, mini-truck
	• The price of spot varies with sizes (hatchback being lowest and mini-truck being highest)
	• App needs to find the best fit/cheapest available spot for the car

### Assumptions:

	• There is only one Entrance and one Exit to the parking lot. Only one car can enter or exit from the lot at a particular time.


## Instructions
Repository has the un-optimized code that implements requirements mentioned above.
* Optimize the code to make it more testable
* Come up with possible test cases and add those automated tests to the solution.
